# Code from the article, "Characterization and optimization of 5â€™ untranslated region containing poly-adenine tracts in *Kluyveromyces marxianus* using machine-learning model"

## introduction
You can find the code used in our article about construction of Full Connected Neural Network (FCNN) model using a mini-library from *Kluyveromyces marxianus* and  how to perform prediction of the model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) sensitivity analysis of features.

First of all, each python file with its required calculated data file(s) should be placed in one folder separately.
